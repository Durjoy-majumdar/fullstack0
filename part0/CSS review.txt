CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the code that style web content. By HTML we make the skeleton of a webpage and CSS is for decoration. One CSS command can be successfully executed if it is connected with HTML and have selector ( For which specific HTML code this will be applied) , property (What to modify) , property value ( what to do) . This is a structure for CSS which is called ruleset. There are specific method we need to follow for writing CSS like HTML. They are,
* Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
* Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
* Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
We are able to select multiple element also by calling them in selector (separated by comma). There are different types of selector also. Like Element selector , Id selector, class selector , attribute selector and so on. We can modify font, colour, size , location and whatever we need to do.
